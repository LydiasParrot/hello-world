# hello-world

For years radios
had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials;
then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were
made touch-‐sensitive-‐you merely had to brush the panels with your
fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general
direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular
expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still
if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme.
